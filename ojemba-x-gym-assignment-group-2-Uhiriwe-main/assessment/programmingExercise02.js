/**
 * PROGRAMMING EXERCISE 02:
 *
 * Negate and then simplify the following statement: `!isCat && !isDog`
 * You can assume that `isCat` and `isDog` are always boolean values.
 * Assign the variable `solution` with your answer.
 *
 * Feel free to write down the steps you are taking to simplify the statement.
 */

const solution = !isCat && !isDog// false;
/*isCat=true;
isDog=true;
when we write !isCat = false and when we write !isDog will be also false.
so in boolean logically false && false == false*/
